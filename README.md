## NAMCOT Numbered Collection
This repository (when fininished) will contain the disassembled code to 18 Famicom games primarily developed and published by Namco for the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom). Officially they were given no sort of compilation name, but because of the numbering scheme assigned to the cartridge labels and box art, they're retroactively being defined here as the NAMCOT Numbered Collection.
