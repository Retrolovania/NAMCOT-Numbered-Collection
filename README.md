## NAMCOT Numbered Collection
This repository (when finished) will contain the disassembled code to 18 Famicom games primarily developed and published by Namco for the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom). Officially they were given no sort of compilation name, but because of the numbering scheme assigned to the cartridge labels and box art, they're retroactively being defined here as the NAMCOT Numbered Collection.

# Purpose
This project is dedicated to preserving the legacy of classic Namco titles and providing a resource for enthusiasts, historians, and researchers interested in the history of video game development. It's also a labor of love, being done to recognize the legacy these games continue to hold decades after their publication. By allowing this code to be viewable, we intend to uphold the craftsmenship and ingenuity that went into creating these iconic (and some lesser iconic) titles.
